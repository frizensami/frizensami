### About me

I am a Computer Science PhD student at the National University of Singapore. My current research focuses on **security and privacy issues** and **novel use-cases** for **active sensors** (LIDARs, time-of-flight sensors, etc).

You can find my research [here](https://sriramsami.com/research) and more about my teaching [here](https://sriramsami.com/teaching/).

### Areas of interest

- I like working on *programming languages* like this [Singlish-based one](https://github.com/frizensami/singlang) and [understanding the quirks of other languages](https://github.com/frizensami/haskell-optimization).
- I try to find ways to do *social good* using code, such as this [blood stock tracker for Singapore](https://github.com/frizensami/singapore-bloodstocks-bot) and my [research project to find hidden cameras using just a smartphone](https://github.com/frizensami/lapd).
- I also enjoy making *productivity tools* such as this [module/timetable optimizer](https://github.com/frizensami/nus-timetable-optimizer) and a [Chrome extension to see relevant discussions](https://github.com/UseCrowdWise/crowdwise) based on the webpage you're on.
- I make *teaching tools* when possible such as this [plagiarism checker](https://github.com/frizensami/plagiarism-basic) and the beginnings of [an operating system for teaching puposes](https://github.com/frizensami/ramos).
- I've made a few [collaborative](https://github.com/frizensami/treehouse-game) and [experimental](https://github.com/frizensami/dixit) *games*.
- When possible, I try to find real-world cases for *timing-sensitive distributed systems* like this [marathon timing controller](https://github.com/frizensami/tvm).
- In general, I have a wide range of random interests such as [group matching through Hamiltonian cycles](https://github.com/frizensami/archangel), [group formation with genetic algorithms](https://github.com/frizensami/group-matching), [formal proofs using TLA+](https://github.com/frizensami/tlaplus-projects), etc.


If you'd like to work together on something, I'm always game.
